            <h1>Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum</h1>
            <h2>What it is all about?</h2>
            <p>Let's start with the big one. Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, that can be sent on
                the
                peer-to-peer network. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people
                using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as an
                open-source project.</p>

            <h2 style="padding: 2% 2% 0 2%;">So what's so special about it?</h2>
            <p>Well, it is mostly thanks to something called a blockchain. Another weird name? Yes, but it's not very
                complicated. Actually, it is but let me explain in few words. Blockchain is a public database that
                records transactions that are stored in chained blocks. In Bitcoinâ€™s case, blockchain is used in a
                decentralized way so that no single person or group has control. Another benefit is that transactions
                are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.</p>

            <h2 style="padding: 2% 2% 0 2%;">Ethereum?</h2>
            <p>Ethereum is not actually a cryptocurrency, it is an open-source blockchain. However, it has a native
                currency called Ether that is used in transactions and as a "gas fee". Ethereum is after Bitcoin
                second-largest crypto on the market. Its price has very close relations with the number one currency.
                The chart below shows the price over time of both assets.</p>

            <h2 style="padding: 2% 2% 0 2%;">What about Dogecoin?</h2>
            <p>Dogecoin is the little brother of Bitcoin. Or more like a cousin, you didn't know existed until he became
                famous because of a joke. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency with a face of Shiba Inu dog created as a joke.
                It was introduced on December 6, 2013, but only recently, at the end of 2020 started gaining attention.
                As a result of the TikTok trend, Reddit users and Elon Musk price surged to 0.07$ in January 2021.
                Currently, memecoin is in the top 10 of the total market capitalization of crypto assets.</p>

            <h2 style="padding: 2% 2% 0 2%;">How crypto stands comapred to other assets?</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies are very volatile and can have huge downsides or huge upsides. Let's take Dogecoin as an
                example - 20000% return in one year while more traditional assets usually are around 10%. On May 22,
                2010, Laszlo Hanyecz agreed to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for two delivered Papa John's pizzas. On its 11th
                anniversary in 2021, the bitcoin price reached a high of $63,000. So, the two pizzas were worth $630
                million. Below spreadsheet with returns of Bitcoin and a few traditional assets in the last years.</p>
